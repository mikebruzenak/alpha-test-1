### My assumption is that this is a prototype. so a little heavy on CSS. I am not entirely satisfied with tests on mobile with Chrome tools but have to move on. 
### A more responsive design would take some interactions with designers and UI team. 
### I like styled-components. Allows for much cleaner code on a CSS heavy project.
